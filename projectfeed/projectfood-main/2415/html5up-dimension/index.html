								<h1>Feeding Ontario's Future - Food Bank Usage Mapping</h1>
								<p>
									Food insecurity poses a significant challenge in Ontario, impacting numerous individuals and families who depend on food bank 
									services for their essential needs. In response, Feed Ontario is developing an interactive web platform to showcase food bank 
									usage data across provincial electoral ridings. This initiative builds upon prior work, utilizing Geographic Information Systems 
									(GIS) techniques to visualize and assess food bank usage and food insecurity within these electoral areas. The project emphasizes 
									expertise in data acquisition and processing, cartographic design, spatial and statistical analysis, as well as enterprise technologies.

								<h2 class="major">METHODOLOGY</h2>
								<h3>OVERALL PROJECT WORKFLOW</h3>
									<p>The project adopted the agile project management method. Agile development is an iterative software development 
										process that prioritized short term outputs that are modified over time in response to client feedback. Over 
										the course of project, a substantial quantity of client input was obtained, enabling the team to adjust to changes 
										and involve the client’s requirements in the decision-making process.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/wf1.jpg" alt="" ></span>
								<h3>Data Pre-Processing </h3>
									<p>Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates, allowing them to be positioned on a map. 
										This process was accomplished using ArcGIS Pro. To achieve this, a 6-digit postal code shape file across Ontario was 
										utilized as the reference layer to create a locator. The Create Locator geo-processing tool required mandatory Forward 
										Sortation Area (FSA) and Local Delivery Unit (LDU) fields. It necessitated splitting the 6-digit postal code field into 
										the first 3 digits (FSA) and the last 3 digits (LDU). The Add Fields and Calculate Fields tools were used, with the 
										sample expression “!POSTALCODE![:3]” to extract the first three digits of the postal codes, creating two new fields: 
										FSA and LDU. The raw data criteria were imported into ArcGIS Pro as five separate tables. The Geocode Addresses tool
										utilized the previously created locator and geocoded the five criteria into x-y coordinates based on the postal codes 
										field. This process successfully converted the tables into five point feature classes.</p>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/geocoding.jpg" alt="" ></span>
								
								<p>After importing the data in ArcGIS Pro, the projection was adjusted to Lambert Conformal Conic projection. To 
									facilitate a more accurate analysis of food insecurity through Multi Decision Criteria Analysis, we partitioned 
									the province of Ontario into northern and southern parts. This division was essential because the population was 
									not uniformly distributed in the two regions, particularly with the southern section being highly dense. The 
									northern part of Ontario comprised 9 electoral ridings, while the southern part comprised 112 federal ridings.</p> 
				
								<h3>Spatial Analysis on Food Insecurity</h3>
									<p>The purpose of the analysis was to identify the area prone to hunger and food insecurity. After importing the factors in ArcGIS Pro, 
										the study area was divided into northern and southern regions. Then, a raster surface of all five factors were created using the 
										Polygon to Raster tool. Subsequently, we categorized the data into a 1 to 9 analytical hierarchy process (AHP) schema with 1 being 
										the least suitable and 9 being the most suitable conditions. With the natural break method, the criteria were divided into nine classes, 
										and the results were rounded up. These suitability ratings were coded to reflect the relative suitability within each criterion. </p>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/spatial.jpg" alt="" ></span>
								
								<h3>Statistical Analysis on Food Bank Usage</h3>
									<p>The statistical analysis focused on identifying and comparing food bank usage across 124 electoral ridings between 2021 and 2023. It also 
										examined the total population variation within these ridings during the same period, highlighting the ridings with the highest and lowest 
										populations. The study further investigated the Ontario Works category percentages across these electoral areas for the years 2021 and 2023, 
										identifying both the highest and lowest percentages. Average food bank usage per capita and Ontario Works statistics were calculated for 
										each of the 124 Ontario electoral ridings over the specified years. Additionally, percentage changes in Ontario Works averages from 2021 to 
										2023 and population growth percentages during the same period were computed.</p>
								
								<h3>Cartographic Design</h3>
										<p>The primary cartographic output of this project were the food bank usage map and the food insecurity map. Choropleth thematic map 
											styling were used for rendering data for individually enumerations units. Data was generally grouped into classes and each group 
											of data is organized as a ratio value. A graded orange colour series was used to show least intensity to greatest intensity depiction 
											using a light to dark colour pattern. Low food bank usage per capita intensity was depicted by light color whereas, the high food bank 
											usage per capita intensity was depicted by dark color. The Light Gray Canvas basemap provided a clear contrast. For the visualization 
											of the food insecurity layer, we employed a red-white-blue color schema with nine classes. In this color ramp, dark red indicated a 
											highly vulnerable area, while darker blue signified region of higher security. </p>

								<h3>Web Development and Enterprise Technology</h3>
									<p>Sharing web platforms and utilizing enterprise technology allowed for convenient access, editing, and management between accounts and users. 
										After the maps were created in ArcGIS Pro, the final 2021 and 2023 food bank usage feature layers were shared on the ArcGIS Online platform. 
										A web map was created with the hosted layers, incorporating interactive features such as labeling, filtering, and pop-ups. The interactive 
										web maps allowed users to explore the data in detail. They provided detailed information for each riding boundary, enabling stakeholders to 
										access and analyze the data easily. </p>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/webmap.jpg" alt="" ></span>
									<p>The layers and files were later transferred to the client's ArcGIS account from our Fleming school account to facilitate seamless future management.</p>
									<p>Additionally, other Esri Suite platforms were utilized for further demonstration purposes.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ss.gif" alt="" ></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/os.gif" alt="" ></span>
								<p>The analysis identified five key factors influencing food insecurity: income, employment rate, household size, labor force participation rate, and spending on food. Significant portions of Northern and Southern Ontario were found to be highly vulnerable across these criteria. Using the AHP model and weighted overlay in ArcGIS Pro, specific areas totaling 0.03 sq. km in Northern Ontario and 0.01 sq. km in Southern Ontario were identified as moderately vulnerable to food insecurity. These findings underscore the regional disparities and critical factors contributing to food insecurity in Ontario.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/2021o.gif" alt="" ></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/2023o.gif" alt="" ></span>
								<p>The analysis conducted on food bank usage in Ontario between 2021 and 2023 reveals a significant increase in per capita usage, rising from 3.47% to 5.35%. This indicates a 54.17% escalation, highlighting worsening food insecurity. Specific electoral ridings like Ottawa—Vanier and Scarborough—Guildwood showed notable variations in usage. Ontario's population grew by approximately 1.92 million people, or 14.27%, during this period. The findings emphasize the urgent need for ongoing monitoring and intervention to address growing reliance on food bank services across the province.</p>
